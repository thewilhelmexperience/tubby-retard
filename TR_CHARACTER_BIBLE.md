## 🔮 Future Development Ideas

- **Favorite Mechanic:** Explains things simply, TR still doesn't understand
- **Immigration Officer:** Has TR's file flagged
- **Regular Chef:** Quits often, replaced frequently

### Running Gags to Develop
- TR's ever-present Hawaiian shirt collection
- The Captain's growing therapy fund
- TR's "yachting credentials" getting more ridiculous
- The boat's increasing damage history

## 💡 Writing Tips for Submissions

### What Makes a Good TR Story
1. **Specific detail:** Exact location, boat size, situation
2. **TR's voice:** Can you hear him shouting?
3. **Visual humor:** Can you see the scene?
4. **Irony:** TR thinks he's right, clearly isn't
5. **Relatability:** Other crew members have been there

### What to Avoid
- Too much setup - get to the TR moment quickly
- Complex technical details - focus on the human interaction
- TR being competent - he's not
- Happy endings - TR rarely wins
