## 💡 Writing Tips for Submissions

### What Makes a Good TR Story
1. **Specific detail:** Exact location, boat size, situation
2. **TR's voice:** Can you hear him shouting?
3. **Visual humor:** Can you see the scene?
4. **Irony:** TR thinks he's right, clearly isn't
5. **Relatability:** Other crew members have been there

### What to Avoid
- Too much setup - get to the TR moment quickly
- Complex technical details - focus on the human interaction
- TR being competent - he's not
- Happy endings - TR rarely wins
