### Panel 4: The Reveal

- Captain (deadpan): "Biggest boat, huh?"

**DALL-E Prompt:** "Comic book panel, wide shot from behind two men on yacht looking at marina, three enormous mega yachts over 150 feet long dominating the harbor, tiny 80-foot yacht in foreground for scale, uniformed marina crew running around busy, tropical Bahamian marina setting, shocked embarrassed face on one man, smug captain face on other, cartoon style, bold outlines"

## Notes for Artist

- **TR Character:** Entitled, loud, wearing expensive but tacky yachting attire (polo shirt, sunglasses, maybe a captain's hat he bought himself)
- **Captain:** Professional, long-suffering, in proper uniform, the straight man to TR's antics
- **Tone:** Humorous irony - the buildup of TR's arrogance vs. the reality of actual mega yachts
- **Visual gag:** Make sure the size difference in Panel 4 is dramatic and obvious

**Status:** Awaiting editorial review
