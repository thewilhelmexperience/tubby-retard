# [DRAFT - PENDING REVIEW]
# TR Comic Script: "Test"

**Source Location:** Fort Lauderdale  
**Slug:** test  
**Generated:** Saturday, February 7th, 2026

## Story Summary
A humorous meta-commentary on testing itself — the narrator insists on testing more, suggesting there's a minimum text requirement or perhaps just an obsessive need to validate systems.

---

## Comic Script

### Panel 1: The Setup
**Scene:** A person (let's call them The Tester) sitting at a computer, fingers poised over the keyboard. The screen glows with a generic "SUBMIT" form.

**Tester (thinking):** *"This is only a test..."

**DALL-E Prompt:**
> Comic panel in modern cartoon style. Person with exaggerated expression sitting at glowing computer screen, fingers hovering over keyboard. Thought bubble above head. Warm indoor lighting, casual home office setting. Clean lines, bold colors.

---

### Panel 2: The Doubt
**Scene:** Same angle, but Tester now looks slightly uncertain, glancing sideways at the screen.

**Tester (thinking):** *"Don't you think we should test this some more?"*

**DALL-E Prompt:**
> Comic panel in modern cartoon style. Same character now looking uncertain, side-eyeing computer screen with skeptical expression. Subtle sweat drop or worried lines. Thought bubble with questioning tone. Continuity with Panel 1.

---

### Panel 3: The Panic
**Scene:** Tester is now frantically typing, eyes wide, multiple "TEST TEST TEST" text fragments floating around them like anxious energy.

**Tester (frantic, thinking):** *"There appears to be a need for more text or it won't submit!"*

**DALL-E Prompt:**
> Comic panel in modern cartoon style. Character frantically typing at keyboard, eyes wide with panic. Motion lines and "TEST TEST" text fragments floating around them comically. Exaggerated stress expression. Dynamic action pose.

---

### Panel 4: The Punchline
**Scene:** Tester has collapsed back in their chair, exhausted. The screen now shows "SUBMITTED ✓" But a new notification popup appears: "Your submission was too long. Please shorten."

**Tester (defeated):** *"...Well, that was a test."*

**DALL-E Prompt:**
> Comic panel in modern cartoon style. Character slumped back in chair, exhausted posture, deadpan expression. Computer screen showing success checkmark but ironic error popup. Comedic timing moment. Flat lighting, defeated body language, humor in the defeat.

## Character Notes
- **The Tester:** Represents the everyperson dealing with bureaucratic/form friction
- Keep expressions exaggerated but relatable
- The humor comes from the meta-awareness of the testing process itself

## Style Guidelines
- Modern webcomic aesthetic (think The Oatmeal, SMBC, or similar)
- Bold black outlines with flat or slightly shaded colors
- Emphasis on facial expressions and body language for comedic timing
- Consider a consistent color palette (maybe blues/grays for the tech, warm tones for the character)
