TR stands on the dock or in the boat, holding two ski ropes that are already rigged and ready to go. He's got his cigar and captain's hat, looking pleased.

**TR:** "Alright boys, ropes are rigged! Who's ready to shred?"

**Boys (excited):** "WE ARE!"

**Visual Details:**
- Boys in water, skis on, life jackets, excited expressions
- Two ski ropes ready to go
- TR on dock/boat, cigar in hand, giving thumbs up
- Century ski boat with chrome ski pylon visible

Comic panel in a humorous cartoon style. At a dock next to a vintage wood-grain Century ski boat. Two young boys (around 10 years old) in life jackets and water skis are floating in the water, looking excited and enthusiastic.

He has a cigar in his mouth and looks pleased. Sunny day, lake water, wooden dock. Speech bubble from TR: "Alright boys, ropes are rigged! Who's ready to shred?" Speech from excited boys: "WE ARE!"

## Panel 4: The Abandonment

**Scene:** At the dock. The Century boat is tied off. TR has already stepped onto the dock and is walking away triumphantly down the dock, cigar still in mouth, arms raised in victory, completely ignoring what's behind him. In the water near the dock (but not at it), the two boys are floating exhausted, still in their skis, barely treading water, looking completely spent and abandoned. TR is walking away without a backward glance.

**TR:** *(walking away triumphantly)* "Nailed it! Another perfect lesson!"

**Boy 1 (weakly):** "We... we're still in the water..."

**Boy 2:** "I think... I swallowed half the lake..."

**Visual Details:**
- TR walking down dock away from boat, victory pose, cigar
- Century boat tied to dock, empty
- Boys in water 20-30 feet from dock, exhausted, floating
- Still wearing skis, life jackets
- Complete contrast—TR triumphant vs boys defeated
- Late afternoon lighting

**DALL-E Prompt:**
```
Comic panel in a humorous cartoon style. At a dock, a vintage wood-grain Century ski boat is tied up. A chubby man in a captain's hat and blue Hawaiian shirt with orange flowers is walking triumphantly down the dock AWAY from the boat, arms raised in victory, cigar in mouth, looking proud and satisfied. He is completely ignoring what's behind him. In the lake water near (but not at) the dock, two young boys in life jackets and waterskis are floating exhausted, barely treading water, looking completely spent and abandoned. They're 20-30 feet from the dock. The boys look like they're struggling to stay afloat. TR is walking away without a backward glance. Speech bubble from TR walking away: "Nailed it! Another perfect lesson!" Speech from exhausted Boy 1: "We... we're still in the water..." Speech from Boy 2: "I think... I swallowed half the lake..." Lake dock setting, late afternoon lighting, vintage boat aesthetic, vibrant colors, humorous cartoon exaggeration with dark comedy tone.

## Character Consistency Notes:
- TR: Chubby build, captain's hat with anchor emblem, blue Hawaiian shirt with orange/red flowers, khaki shorts, cigar (puffing smoke in panels 2-4), completely oblivious/confident expression, triumphantly walks away without looking back
- Boys: Around 10 years old, life jackets, waterskis, varying expressions from excited (panel 1) → terrified (panel 3) → exhausted/abandoned (panel 4), left to swim back on their own
- Setting: Vintage wood-grain Century ski boat, lake setting with dock, sunny day turning to late afternoon
- Key details: Two ski ropes, NO spotter ever, one high-speed lap only, TR walks away and leaves boys in the water

## Tone: 
Satirical, darkly absurd, highlighting dangerous incompetence presented as competence. TR is completely unaware that he's abandoned the children in the water. The contrast between his triumph and their exhaustion is the punchline.
