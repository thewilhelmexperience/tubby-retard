## Panel 1: The Setup

**Scene:** Interior of an old woody Century ski boat. TR in his Hawaiian shirt and captain's hat at the helm, turning back to give a thumbs up to two boys (his son and friend) in the water behind the boat. The ski rope is properly attached to the chrome ski pylon (harness) in the center of the boat. The boys are ready in the water with their skis.

**TR:** "Just like the pros, boys! Rope's hooked to the pylon—you're golden!"

**Visual Details:**
- Classic wood-grain Century ski boat interior
- Chrome ski pylon (harness) with rope attached

- Two boys in life jackets, holding ski rope handle, ready in water
- Beautiful sunny day, lake setting

**DALL-E Prompt:**
```
Comic panel in a humorous cartoon style. Interior view of a vintage wood-grain Century ski boat (classic wooden boat). A chubby middle-aged man wearing a captain's hat with anchor emblem and a blue Hawaiian shirt with orange flowers is at the helm, turning back with a big grin and giving thumbs up. In the center of the boat, a shiny chrome ski pylon (harness) has a ski rope attached to it. Through the back of the boat, two young boys (around 10 years old) in life jackets are visible in the water, holding the ski rope handle, ready to waterski. Sunny day, lake water.

## Panel 4: The Aftermath

**Scene:** At the dock. The Century boat is tied up. TR has just stepped onto the dock with his cigar still lit, looking proud and satisfied, walking away. Behind him, the two boys are still attached to the ski pylon by the rope, collapsed on the back seat or swim platform of the boat, completely exhausted, sprawled out like they've just survived an ordeal. The rope is still taut/attached.

**TR:** "Another successful lesson! Who's ready for round two?"

**Boys:** *(too exhausted to respond, one weakly)* "We... we can't feel our arms..."

**Visual Details:**

- Proud posture, patting himself on back
- Century boat tied to dock
- Boys still attached to ski pylon via rope, collapsed on boat

## Character Consistency Notes:
- TR: Chubby build, captain's hat with anchor emblem, blue Hawaiian shirt with orange/red flowers, khaki shorts, cigar (various stages of smoking), oblivious/confident expression
- Boys: Around 10 years old, life jackets, swim trunks, varying expressions from excited → terrified → exhausted
- Setting: Vintage wood-grain Century ski boat, lake water, sunny day
- Key prop: Chrome ski pylon (harness) in center of boat

## Tone: 
Satirical, absurd, highlighting dangerous incompetence presented as competence. TR is completely unaware of how terrifying this was for the children. The vintage Century boat adds to the nostalgic/retro charm.
