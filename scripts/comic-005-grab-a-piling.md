On the flybridge, an exhausted instructor is slumped over the helm, having just pulled the throttles back to stop the boat. Next to him, a sheepish chubby man in a captain's hat and blue Hawaiian shirt is still holding onto the dock piling, looking embarrassed with a weak smile. The boat is barely an inch from hitting the dock. Speech from exhausted instructor: "Let's... try that again. Without the demolition derby." Speech from TR trying to save face: "I was just testing the Emergency Stop feature!" Marina setting, close call, relief and embarrassment. Vibrant colors, comedic expressions.

## Character Consistency Notes:
- TR: Chubby build, captain's hat with anchor emblem, blue Hawaiian shirt with orange/red flowers, khaki shorts, cigar optional, confident → panicked → sheepish
- Instructor: Professional attire (polo), alarmed → bracing → exhausted
- Setting: Large yacht flybridge, marina dock with wooden pilings, Michigan location

## Tone: 
Satirical slapstick, emphasizing the physical comedy of TR's belly hitting throttles while reaching for piling. The close call makes it funny rather than tragic.
